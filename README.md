# Seasonal_Import_Model
The model optimizes hydrogen supply costs to Europe, analyzing cavern costs and seasonal flexibility across six scenarios.

# Description
The import model follows a linear optimization and is designed to determine the supply costs of gaseous and liquid hydrogen by minimizing the total expenditures incurred from the production site to the import node at the European border. Initially, country-specific assumptions, such as techno-economic data, transport distances, daily capacity factors, and renewable energy potentials, are integrated into the model and subsequently segregated into fixed and variable cost components. The optimization framework systematically identifies the most cost-effective production sites and capacity allocations by minimizing the aggregated costs while ensuring that production capacities, efficiency constraints, and European demand requirements are concurrently satisfied. Moreover, the model is applied to six distinct scenarios: two scenarios capture variations in cavern costs (low and base), and three scenarios address the degree of flexibility in seasonal supply variations. This multi-scenario approach enables a robust sensitivity analysis of the supply chain costs under different infrastructural and temporal conditions.
